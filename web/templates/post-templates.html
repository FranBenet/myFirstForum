            <h1 class="post-id-title">Character Development in Fantasy Novels</h1>
            <p class="post-id-description">Character development is one of the most important elements in any story, but in fantasy novels, it often becomes even more essential. Since fantasy worlds tend to be so vast and imaginative, the characters need to feel real and grounded. For me, The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is a masterclass in character development. Kvothe's transformation from a young boy with raw talent to a legendary figure is beautifully written. Another great example is A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. Each character, whether protagonist or antagonist, experiences growth, setbacks, and complexity. Who are your favorite characters that have grown over the course of a series?</p>
